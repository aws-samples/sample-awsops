## Symptoms and verification

A healthy web endpoint does not prove inventory, SSM, AgentCore or worker readiness; inspect disabled backends, pending parameters and failed collection separately.
Use Terraform 1.15.7 and both `scripts/v2/requirements-test.txt` and `scripts/v2/steampipe/requirements.txt`. From the repository root, run these mocked-provider checks:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q scripts/v2/test_ci_*.py
bash scripts/v2/terraform-test.sh
python3 -m pytest -q scripts/v2/steampipe/test_host_scope.py
node --test scripts/v2/ci/prepare-runtime-host.test.mjs
```

## Activation

1. Configure the **secret** `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_DEV`, backend and existing CI roles. Checks establish account/role consistency, not dev/production isolation.
2. A new inactive stack needs foundation, migration and working login first. `CI_READONLY_RUNTIME_DEV=true` enables core runtime, without enabling the separate readiness capability; manual full plan/apply require real login/DB and an enabled host registry with no enabled foreign rows.
3. `runtime-ecr-bootstrap` creates only three repositories. Build ARM64 images and set verified `STEAMPIPE_IMAGE_DIGEST_DEV` / `WORKER_IMAGE_DIGEST_DEV` before a full plan.
4. Dev/preview private discovery requires full-plan `runtime_rollout=true` and DNS permission; dev also requires the profile. Keep `domain_rollout=false`. Profile/rollout require remediation, RCA write-back, integrations write and diagnosis notifications off; governed external writes are not reclassified as FROZEN.
5. Review/apply the same branch/SHA plan and encrypted assets. Preserve public DNS, certificates and network topology; unchanged owned ECS registration still requires DNS permission. Missing/mismatched bundles require a new plan. `CI_ASSETS_READY=true` selects layer verification, not rebuilding.

```bash
# After the profile, base application and verified digests are configured:
gh workflow run terraform.yml -R aws-samples/sample-awsops --ref dev -f mode=plan -f plan_scope=full -f runtime_rollout=true -f allow_dns_changes=true
```
Host-only removes only collector AssumeRole; Agent MCP grants remain. IAM includes known regions regardless of current opt-in; newly launched AWS regions require a fresh apply. IAM narrowing also applies to already-enabled main/preview stacks independently of the dev profile.
S3 steady denials remain unknown: rows carry `attributes_unknown`, the ledger increments `unknown_attribute_count`, and freshness is `degraded`; full readiness rejects that incomplete evidence.
The digest/host-preflight profile is dev-only. Preview retains operator-configured mutable tags or digests and multi-account scope, without dev host verification; account/role and private-DNS ownership checks still apply.

## Readiness capability

Saved-plan JSON can retain CLI Boolean inputs as the exact strings `true`/`false`,
while Terraform's effective values are Boolean. The readiness policy decodes only
those canonical spellings and real Booleans; other strings, numbers and null remain
invalid. The dev-only, separate opt-in and checked-saved-plan controls still apply.

`CI_READONLY_RUNTIME_DEV` does not grant billed-probe access. The dedicated dev repository variable `CI_READINESS_ENABLED_DEV` is independent of that profile:

| Value | Terraform behavior on dev |
|---|---|
| `true` | Explicitly sets `ci_readiness_enabled=true`. |
| `false` | Explicitly sets it false, overriding a true value in restored tfvars. |
| Empty/unset | Emits no readiness override; preserves explicit tfvars and the default false. Unsetting is not revocation. |

Other values are rejected. The workflow forwards this variable only on dev; helper opt-in and public-CI plan checks reject enabled readiness elsewhere. Direct Terraform remains explicit operator configuration. With readiness and AgentCore both enabled, a reviewed apply creates `deployment-verifiers`; automatic membership additionally requires the Terraform-managed demo (`create_demo_user=true`). No admin or IAM role is granted. Every holder of that shared demo login can then access the existing bounded billed model probe, so this must be a separate operator decision. The endpoint retains authentication, one in-flight request and a per-process cooldown; group creation is not deployment-readiness proof.

Use a fresh normal login to obtain new group claims. `terraform/foundation/auth.tf` configures **12-hour ID/access tokens**; `web/lib/auth.ts` reads groups from the ID token and checks the existing session-revocation store. Removing membership does not rewrite issued tokens: they can retain verifier authorization for their remaining lifetime, up to 12 hours, unless session revocation rejects them. Disabling the runtime is a separate control and can block the probe even while an old group claim remains. For urgent removal, use the existing [offboarding/session-revocation procedure](user-offboarding.md); do not reset a password to make verification pass.

An explicit false decision still needs the reviewed apply to remove managed membership/group state. When AgentCore is disabled, the web task's `SSM_RUNTIME_ARN_PARAM` is empty; invocation and status lookup respect that blank. The separate `AGENTCORE_RUNTIME_ARN_PARAM` alias and the incident bridge's literal project paths remain unchanged. Status discovery does not validate the full runtime ARN or prove invocation readiness, and other control-plane status reads can still run.

## Rollback

Retain runtime resources and restore reviewed prior digests/settings. Manual dev/preview plans and apply block listed core deletion/replacement/forget; this development policy does not cover main. No retirement mode is provided. A destructive teardown needs a separate reviewed procedure covering Aurora ingress, migration dependencies and optional gates.

<a id="promotion-to-main--main-승격"></a>

## Promotion to main

Sequence: merge reviewed code to dev → reviewed dev apply and full live readiness → main promotion → reviewed production apply. Do not promote this IAM narrowing until live dev exercises verify gateway-backed chat, worker diagnosis, and an SFN/Fargate run with managed tags. Record actual identities, outcomes and denied operations privately; a mock plan or IAM document alone cannot satisfy this promotion gate. This dev PR is the prerequisite for that evidence, not production deployment authorization.
